We conclude\\nthat both components are young, comoving members of the association; we also\\npresent high-resolution observations which show that the primary is itself a\\nclose binary system. If the Aab and B components are gravitationally bound, the\\nsystem would fall into the small class of young multiple systems which have\\nunusually wide separations as compared to field systems of similar mass.\\nHowever, we demonstrate that physical association can not be assumed purely on\\nprobabilistic grounds for any individual candidate system in this separation\\nrange. Analysis of the association's two-point correlation function shows that\\nthere is a significant probability (25%) that at least one pair of low-mass\\nassociation members will be separated in projection by <15\\\", so analysis of the\\nwide binary population in Upper Sco will require a systematic search for all\\nwide systems; the detection of another such pair would represent an excess at\\nthe 98% confidence level.\\n\",\n          \"  We calculate the form factors for the semileptonic decays of heavy-light\\npseudoscalar mesons in partially quenched staggered chiral perturbation theory\\n(\\\\schpt), working to leading order in $1/m_Q$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark\\nmass. We take the light meson in the final state to be a pseudoscalar\\ncorresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatment\\nassumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing the\\nstaggered ``fourth root trick'' within \\\\schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4\\nfor each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partially\\nquenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate sea\\nquarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered\\n(and non-degenerate) case. As a by-product, we obtain the continuum partially\\nquenched results with non-degenerate sea quarks. We analyze the effects of\\nnon-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governing\\nthe analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful in\\nanalyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\\\\to\\\\pi$ and $D\\\\to K$ when the\\nlight quarks are simulated with the staggered action.\\n\",\n          \"  The minimum semi-degree of a digraph D is the minimum of its minimum\\noutdegree and its minimum indegree. We show that every sufficiently large\\ndigraph D with minimum semi-degree at least n/2 +k-1 is k-linked. The bound on\\nthe minimum semi-degree is best possible and confirms a conjecture of\\nManoussakis from 1990. We also determine the smallest minimum semi-degree which\\nensures that a sufficiently large digraph D is k-ordered, i.e. that for every\\nordered sequence of k distinct vertices of D there is a directed cycle which\\nencounters these vertices in this order.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"update_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"object\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 256,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2014-11-21\",\n          \"2009-02-05\",\n          \"2010-08-27\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

We conclude\\nthat both components are young, comoving members of the association; we also\\npresent high-resolution observations which show that the primary is itself a\\nclose binary system. If the Aab and B components are gravitationally bound, the\\nsystem would fall into the small class of young multiple systems which have\\nunusually wide separations as compared to field systems of similar mass.\\nHowever, we demonstrate that physical association can not be assumed purely on\\nprobabilistic grounds for any individual candidate system in this separation\\nrange. Analysis of the association's two-point correlation function shows that\\nthere is a significant probability (25%) that at least one pair of low-mass\\nassociation members will be separated in projection by <15\\\", so analysis of the\\nwide binary population in Upper Sco will require a systematic search for all\\nwide systems; the detection of another such pair would represent an excess at\\nthe 98% confidence level.\\n\",\n          \"  We calculate the form factors for the semileptonic decays of heavy-light\\npseudoscalar mesons in partially quenched staggered chiral perturbation theory\\n(\\\\schpt), working to leading order in $1/m_Q$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark\\nmass. We take the light meson in the final state to be a pseudoscalar\\ncorresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatment\\nassumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing the\\nstaggered ``fourth root trick'' within \\\\schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4\\nfor each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partially\\nquenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate sea\\nquarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered\\n(and non-degenerate) case. As a by-product, we obtain the continuum partially\\nquenched results with non-degenerate sea quarks. We analyze the effects of\\nnon-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governing\\nthe analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful in\\nanalyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\\\\to\\\\pi$ and $D\\\\to K$ when the\\nlight quarks are simulated with the staggered action.\\n\",\n          \"  The minimum semi-degree of a digraph D is the minimum of its minimum\\noutdegree and its minimum indegree. We show that every sufficiently large\\ndigraph D with minimum semi-degree at least n/2 +k-1 is k-linked. The bound on\\nthe minimum semi-degree is best possible and confirms a conjecture of\\nManoussakis from 1990. We also determine the smallest minimum semi-degree which\\nensures that a sufficiently large digraph D is k-ordered, i.e. that for every\\nordered sequence of k distinct vertices of D there is a directed cycle which\\nencounters these vertices in this order.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"update_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2007-05-23 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2024-02-13 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 256,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2014-11-21 00:00:00\",\n          \"2009-02-05 00:00:00\",\n          \"2010-08-27 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"year\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"int32\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 18,\n        \"samples\": [\n          2008,\n          2007,\n          2011\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"abstract_length\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 401,\n        \"min\": 44,\n        \"max\": 1869,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 728,\n        \"samples\": [\n          397,\n          892,\n          691\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"number_of_authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 44,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 26,\n        \"samples\": [\n          20,\n          26,\n          4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

We conclude\\nthat both components are young, comoving members of the association; we also\\npresent high-resolution observations which show that the primary is itself a\\nclose binary system. If the Aab and B components are gravitationally bound, the\\nsystem would fall into the small class of young multiple systems which have\\nunusually wide separations as compared to field systems of similar mass.\\nHowever, we demonstrate that physical association can not be assumed purely on\\nprobabilistic grounds for any individual candidate system in this separation\\nrange. Analysis of the association's two-point correlation function shows that\\nthere is a significant probability (25%) that at least one pair of low-mass\\nassociation members will be separated in projection by <15\\\", so analysis of the\\nwide binary population in Upper Sco will require a systematic search for all\\nwide systems; the detection of another such pair would represent an excess at\\nthe 98% confidence level.\\n\",\n          \"  We calculate the form factors for the semileptonic decays of heavy-light\\npseudoscalar mesons in partially quenched staggered chiral perturbation theory\\n(\\\\schpt), working to leading order in $1/m_Q$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark\\nmass. We take the light meson in the final state to be a pseudoscalar\\ncorresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatment\\nassumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing the\\nstaggered ``fourth root trick'' within \\\\schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4\\nfor each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partially\\nquenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate sea\\nquarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered\\n(and non-degenerate) case. As a by-product, we obtain the continuum partially\\nquenched results with non-degenerate sea quarks. We analyze the effects of\\nnon-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governing\\nthe analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful in\\nanalyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\\\\to\\\\pi$ and $D\\\\to K$ when the\\nlight quarks are simulated with the staggered action.\\n\",\n          \"  The minimum semi-degree of a digraph D is the minimum of its minimum\\noutdegree and its minimum indegree. We show that every sufficiently large\\ndigraph D with minimum semi-degree at least n/2 +k-1 is k-linked. The bound on\\nthe minimum semi-degree is best possible and confirms a conjecture of\\nManoussakis from 1990. We also determine the smallest minimum semi-degree which\\nensures that a sufficiently large digraph D is k-ordered, i.e. that for every\\nordered sequence of k distinct vertices of D there is a directed cycle which\\nencounters these vertices in this order.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"update_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2007-05-23 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2024-02-13 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 256,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2014-11-21 00:00:00\",\n          \"2009-02-05 00:00:00\",\n          \"2010-08-27 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"number_of_authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 44,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 26,\n        \"samples\": [\n          20,\n          26,\n          4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Measurement of Decay Amplitudes of B -->(c cbar) Kstar with an Angular\\n  Analysis, for (c cbar)=J/psi, psi(2S) and chi_c1   We perform the first three-dimensional measurement of the amplitudes of $B\\\\to\\n\\\\psi(2S) K^*$ and $B\\\\to \\\\chi_{c1} K^*$ decays and update our previous\\nmeasurement for $B\\\\to J/\\\\psi K^*$.

The energy injected at the outer scale scale has to be converted\\ninto heat, which ultimately cannot be done without collisions. A KINETIC\\nCASCADE develops that brings the energy to collisional scales both in space and\\nvelocity. Its nature depends on the physics of plasma fluctuations. In each of\\nthe physically distinct scale ranges, the kinetic problem is systematically\\nreduced to a more tractable set of equations. In the \"inertial range\" above the\\nion gyroscale, the kinetic cascade splits into a cascade of Alfvenic\\nfluctuations, which are governed by the RMHD equations at both the collisional\\nand collisionless scales, and a passive cascade of compressive fluctuations,\\nwhich obey a linear kinetic equation along the moving field lines associated\\nwith the Alfvenic component. In the \"dissipation range\" between the ion and\\nelectron gyroscales, there are again two cascades: the kinetic-Alfven-wave\\n(KAW) cascade governed by two fluid-like Electron RMHD equations and a passive\\nphase-space cascade of ion entropy fluctuations. The latter cascade brings the\\nenergy of the inertial-range fluctuations that was damped by collisionless\\nwave-particle interaction at the ion gyroscale to collisional scales in the\\nphase space and leads to ion heating. The KAW energy is similarly damped at the\\nelectron gyroscale and converted into electron heat. Kolmogorov-style scaling\\nrelations are derived for these cascades.

              " 'Dynamical Objects for Cohomologically Expanding Maps   The goal of this paper is to construct invariant dynamical objects for a (not\\nnecessarily invertible) smooth self map of a compact manifold. We prove a\\nresult that takes advantage of differences in rates of expansion in the terms\\nof a sheaf cohomological long exact sequence to create unique lifts of finite\\ndimensional invariant subspaces of one term of the sequence to invariant\\nsubspaces of the preceding term. This allows us to take invariant cohomological\\nclasses and under the right circumstances construct unique currents of a given\\ntype, including unique measures of a given type, that represent those classes\\nand are invariant under pullback. A dynamically interesting self map may have a\\nplethora of invariant measures, so the uniquess of the constructed currents is\\nimportant. It means that if local growth is not too big compared to the growth\\nrate of the cohomological class then the expanding cohomological class gives\\nsufficient \"marching orders\" to the system to prohibit the formation of any\\nother such invariant current of the same type (say from some local dynamical\\nsubsystem). Because we use subsheaves of the sheaf of currents we give\\nconditions under which a subsheaf will have the same cohomology as the sheaf\\ncontaining it. Using a smoothing argument this allows us to show that the sheaf\\ncohomology of the currents under consideration can be canonically identified\\nwith the deRham cohomology groups. Our main theorem can be applied in both the\\nsmooth and holomorphic setting.\\n',\n",

Various\\nmechanisms, such as the hyperfine interaction with the surrounding nuclei, the\\nDresselhaus spin-orbit coupling together with the electron--bulk-phonon\\ninteraction, the $g$-factor fluctuations, the direct spin-phonon coupling due\\nto the phonon-induced strain, and the coaction of the\\nelectron--bulk/surface-phonon interaction together with the hyperfine\\ninteraction are included. The relative contributions from these spin\\ndecoherence mechanisms are compared in detail. In our calculation, the\\nspin-orbit coupling is included in each mechanism and is shown to have marked\\neffect in most cases. The equation-of-motion approach is applied in studying\\nboth the spin relaxation time $T_1$ and the spin dephasing time $T_2$, either\\nin Markovian or in non-Markovian limit. When many levels are involved at finite\\ntemperature, we demonstrate how to obtain the spin relaxation time from the\\nFermi Golden rule in the limit of weak spin-orbit coupling. However, at high\\ntemperature and/or for large spin-orbit coupling, one has to use the\\nequation-of-motion approach when many levels are involved.

Here we analyze the performance of\\nRandom Vector Quantization (RVQ), in which the precoding matrix is selected\\nfrom a random codebook containing independent, isotropically distributed\\nentries. We assume that channel elements are i.i.d. and known to the receiver,\\nwhich relays the optimal (rate-maximizing) precoder codebook index to the\\ntransmitter using B bits. We first derive the large system capacity of\\nbeamforming (rank-one precoding matrix) as a function of B, where large system\\nrefers to the limit as B and the number of transmit and receive antennas all go\\nto infinity with fixed ratios. With beamforming RVQ is asymptotically optimal,\\ni.e., no other quantization scheme can achieve a larger asymptotic rate. The\\nperformance of RVQ is also compared with that of a simpler reduced-rank scalar\\nquantization scheme in which the beamformer is constrained to lie in a random\\nsubspace. We subsequently consider a precoding matrix with arbitrary rank, and\\napproximate the asymptotic RVQ performance with optimal and linear receivers\\n(matched filter and Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE)). Numerical examples show\\nthat these approximations accurately predict the performance of finite-size\\nsystems of interest. Given a target spectral efficiency, numerical examples\\nshow that the amount of feedback required by the linear MMSE receiver is only\\nslightly more than that required by the optimal receiver, whereas the matched\\nfilter can require significantly more feedback.\\n',\n",

Furthermore, the recent data allow for\\na new independent method of constraining sigma/m, based on the non-observation\\nof an offset between the bullet subcluster mass peak and galaxy centroid.

An intensive observing campaign demonstrates that the excess dispersion\\nis due to two superimposed coherent signals, with periods of 4.69 and 35 days.\\nResults: These data are well described by a 2-planet Keplerian model where each\\nplanet has a ~11 Mearth minimum mass.

One of the\\ninteresting consequences of pion propagation in ANM is the mode splitting for\\nthe different charged states of pions.

For both of these cases the effect\\nof the Dirac sea is estimated.

The results are compared with the\\nprevious calculations for the case of symmetric nuclear matter (SNM). Closed\\nform analytical results are presented for the effective pion masses and\\ndispersion relations by making hard nucleon loop (HNL) approximation and\\nsuitable density expansion.\\n',\n",

These data confirm the presence of a cold dust disk\\naround TWA 7, a member of the TW Hydrae Association. Based on the 850 micron\\nflux, we estimate the mass of the disk to be 18 lunar masses (0.2 Earth masses)\\nassuming a mass opacity of 1.7 cm^2/g with a temperature of 45 K. This makes\\nthe TWA 7 disk (d=55 pc) an order of magnitude more massive than the disk\\nreported around AU Microscopii (GL 803), the closest (9.9 pc) debris disk\\ndetected around an M dwarf. This is consistent with TWA 7 being slightly\\nyounger than AU Mic. We find that the mid-IR and submillimeter data require the\\ndisk to be comprised of dust at a range of temperatures. A model in which the\\ndust is at a single radius from the star, with a range of temperatures\\naccording to grain size, is as effective at fitting the emission spectrum as a\\nmodel in which the dust is of uniform size, but has a range of temperatures\\naccording to distance.

We study different coding strategies in\\nthe single-source single-destination network with many relay nodes. Given the\\nmyriad of ways in which nodes can cooperate, there is a natural routing\\nproblem, i.e., determining an ordered set of nodes to relay the data from the\\nsource to the destination. We find that for a given route, the\\ndecode-and-forward strategy, which is an information theoretic cooperative\\ncoding strategy, achieves rates significantly higher than that achievable by\\nthe usual multi-hop coding strategy, which is a point-to-point non-cooperative\\ncoding strategy. We construct an algorithm to find an optimal route (in terms\\nof rate maximizing) for the decode-and-forward strategy. Since the algorithm\\nruns in factorial time in the worst case, we propose a heuristic algorithm that\\nruns in polynomial time. The heuristic algorithm outputs an optimal route when\\nthe nodes transmit independent codewords. We implement these coding strategies\\nusing practical low density parity check codes to compare the performance of\\nthe strategies on different routes.\\n',\n",

Archival INTEGRAL data\\nand RXTE observations showed that the outbursts occur with a periodicity of\\n~330 days. Thus, IGR J11215-5952 is the first SFXT displaying periodic\\noutbursts, possibly related to the orbital period. We performed a Target of\\nOpportunity observation with Swift with the main aim of monitoring the source\\nbehaviour around the time of the fifth outburst, expected on 2007 Feb 9. The\\nsource field was observed with Swift twice a day (2ks/day) starting from 4th\\nFebruary, 2007, until the fifth outburst, and then for ~5 ks a day afterwards,\\nduring a monitoring campaign that lasted 23 days for a total on-source exposure\\nof ~73 ks. This is the most complete monitoring campaign of an outburst from a\\nSFXT. The spectrum during the brightest flares is well described by an absorbed\\npower law with a photon index of 1 and N_H~1 10^22 cm^-2. A 1-10 keV peak\\nluminosity of ~10^36 erg s^-1 was derived (assuming 6.2 kpc, the distance of\\nthe optical counterpart).

We find that\\nthe outflows tend to escape to low density regions, and hardly affect the dense\\nfilaments visible in HI absorption. As a result, the strength of HI absorption\\nnear galaxies is not reduced by galactic winds, but even slightly increases. We\\nalso find that a lack of HI absorption for lines of sight (LOS) close to\\ngalaxies, as found by Adelberger et al., can be created by hot gas around the\\ngalaxies induced by accretion shock heating. In contrast to HI, metal\\nabsorption systems are sensitive to the presence of winds. The models without\\nfeedback can produce the strong CIV and OVI absorption lines in LOS within 50\\nkpc from galaxies, while strong SN feedback is capable of creating strong CIV\\nand OVI lines out to about twice that distance. We also analyze the mean\\ntransmissivity of HI, CIV, and OVI within 1 h$^{-1}$ Mpc from star-forming\\ngalaxies. The probability distribution of the transmissivity of HI is\\nindependent of the strength of SN feedback, but strong feedback produces LOS\\nwith lower transmissivity of metal lines.

The high spatial resolution of the MSX\\nobservations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the\\nsky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches\\nwell the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path\\nacross the sky we find that BD+43 3654 was located near the central, densest\\nregion of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.\\n  Conclusions: BD+43 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway\\nstars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2.

              " '3-D Simulations of Ergospheric Disk Driven Poynting Jets   This Letter reports on 3-dimensional simulations of Kerr black hole\\nmagnetospheres that obey the general relativistic equations of perfect\\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD). In particular, we study powerful Poynting flux\\ndominated jets that are driven from dense gas in the equatorial plane in the\\nergosphere. The physics of which has been previously studied in the simplified\\nlimit of an ergopsheric disk. For high spin black holes, $a/M > 0.95$, the\\nergospheric disk is prominent in the 3-D simulations and is responsible for\\ngreatly enhanced Poynting flux emission. Any large scale poloidal magnetic flux\\nthat is trapped in the equatorial region leads to an enormous release of\\nelectromagnetic energy that dwarfs the jet energy produced by magnetic flux\\nthreading the event horizon. The implication is that magnetic flux threading\\nthe equatorial plane of the ergosphere is a likely prerequisite for the central\\nengine of powerful FRII quasars.\\n',\n",

Two cases of shock propagation are considered: 1)\\nthrough a gradient of ambient density with a uniform ambient magnetic field; 2)\\nthrough a homogeneous medium with a gradient of ambient magnetic field\\nstrength. From the simulations, we synthesize the synchrotron radio emission,\\nmaking different assumptions about the details of acceleration and injection of\\nrelativistic electrons.\\n  RESULTS: We find that asymmetric BSNRs are produced if the line-of-sight is\\nnot aligned with the gradient of ambient plasma density or with the gradient of\\nambient magnetic field strength. We derive useful parameters to quantify the\\ndegree of asymmetry of the remnants that may provide a powerful diagnostic of\\nthe microphysics of strong shock waves through the comparison between models\\nand observations.\\n  CONCLUSIONS: BSNRs with two radio limbs of different brightness can be\\nexplained if a gradient of ambient density or, most likely, of ambient magnetic\\nfield strength is perpendicular to the radio limbs.

              " 'Nonstationary pattern in unsynchronizable complex networks   Pattern formation and evolution in unsynchronizable complex networks are\\ninvestigated. Due to the asymmetric topology, the synchronous patterns formed\\nin complex networks are irregular and nonstationary. For coupling strength\\nimmediately out of the synchronizable region, the typical phenomenon is the\\non-off intermittency of the system dynamics. The patterns appeared in this\\nprocess are signatured by the coexistence of a giant cluster, which comprises\\nmost of the nodes, and a few number of small clusters. The pattern evolution is\\ncharacterized by the giant cluster irregularly absorbs or emits the small\\nclusters. As the coupling strength leaves away from the synchronization\\nbifurcation point, the giant cluster is gradually dissolved into a number of\\nsmall clusters, and the system dynamics is characterized by the integration and\\nseparation of the small clusters. Dynamical mechanisms and statistical\\nproperties of the nonstationary pattern evolution are analyzed and conducted,\\nand some scalings are newly revealed. Remarkably, it is found that the few\\nactive nodes, which escape from the giant cluster with a high frequency, are\\nindependent of the coupling strength while are sensitive to the bifurcation\\ntypes. We hope our findings about nonstationary pattern could give additional\\nunderstandings to the dynamics of complex systems and have implications to some\\nreal problems where systems maintain their normal functions only in the\\nunsynchronizable state.\\n',\n",

The\\nrate of evolution of the IR luminosity from Coma to MS 1054-03 is consistent\\nwith that found in field galaxies, and it suggests that some internal\\nmechanism, e.g., the consumption of the gas fuel, is responsible for the\\ngeneral decline of the cosmic star formation rate (SFR) in different\\nenvironments.

The signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is usually a main factor in\\ndetermining the probability of error (or of communication failure) in a link.\\nThese probabilities are then a proxy for the SNR under which the links operate.\\nThe paper studies the problem of designing the topology, i.e., assigning the\\nprobabilities of reliable communication among sensors (or of link failures) to\\nmaximize the rate of convergence of average consensus, when the link\\ncommunication costs are taken into account, and there is an overall\\ncommunication budget constraint.

In this paper, we consider whether cosmogenic neutrinos can be a\\nclue to judge which scenario is favored. We calculated the fluxes of cosmogenic\\nneutrinos following these scenarios with plausible physical parameter sets, and\\nfound several important features as follows. First of all, the neutrino flux at\\n$\\\\sim 10^{20}$ eV becomes much higher in the ankle-transition scenario as long\\nas the maximum energy of the cosmic rays at sources is sufficiently high. On\\nthe other hand, the neutrino spectrum has a characteristic peak at $\\\\sim\\n10^{16}$ eV in the proton-dip scenario on the condition that extragalactic\\nprotons significantly contribute to the observed cosmic rays down to $10^{17}$\\neV. Thus, we conclude cosmogenic neutrinos should give us a clue to judge which\\nscenario is favored, unless these features are masked by the neutrino\\nbackground coming from possible, powerful neutrino sources such as AGNs and\\nGRBs. We also found an interesting feature that the neutrino flux at $\\\\sim\\n10^{18}$ eV depends only on the cosmological evolution of the cosmic ray\\nsources. That means cosmogenic neutrinos with the energy bring us information\\non the cosmological evolution of the sources of ultra-high energy cosmic rays.\\nFinally, we compare the fluxes of cosmogenic neutrinos with the expected\\nsensitivity curves of several neutrino detectors, and conclude the detection of\\ncosmogenic neutrinos in the near future is promising.\\n',\n",

In contrast to double\\ndots in GaAs, the spin-orbit coupling is found to be more than two orders of\\nmagnitudes larger than the hyperfine mixing energy.

              " \"Daemons and DAMA: Their Celestial-Mechanics Interrelations   The assumption of the capture by the Solar System of the electrically charged\\nPlanckian DM objects (daemons) from the galactic disk is confirmed not only by\\nthe St.Petersburg (SPb) experiments detecting particles with V<30 km/s. Here\\nthe daemon approach is analyzed considering the positive model independent\\nresult of the DAMA/NaI experiment. We explain the maximum in DAMA signals\\nobserved in the May-June period to be associated with the formation behind the\\nSun of a trail of daemons that the Sun captures into elongated orbits as it\\nmoves to the apex. The range of significant 2-6-keV DAMA signals fits well the\\niodine nuclei elastically knocked out of the NaI(Tl) scintillator by particles\\nfalling on the Earth with V=30-50 km/s from strongly elongated heliocentric\\norbits. The half-year periodicity of the slower daemons observed in SPb\\noriginates from the transfer of particles that are deflected through ~90 deg\\ninto near-Earth orbits each time the particles cross the outer reaches of the\\nSun which had captured them. Their multi-loop (cross-like) trajectories\\ntraverse many times the Earth's orbit in March and September, which increases\\nthe probability for the particles to enter near-Earth orbits during this time.\\nCorroboration of celestial mechanics calculations with observations yields\\n~1e-19 cm2 for the cross section of daemon interaction with the solar matter.\\n\",\n",

This paper demonstrates conceptually evolvable embedded systems\\ncan be characterized basing on acausal nature.

This tensor is closely related to\\ngravitoelectromagnetic field quantities. We construct the set of tetrad fields\\nadapted to observers that are in free fall in the Schwarzschild spacetime, and\\nshow that the gravitational energy-momentum constructed out of this set of\\ntetrad fields, in the framework of the teleparallel equivalent of general\\nrelatrivity, vanishes.

              " 'A kind of prediction from string phenomenology: extra matter at low\\n  energy   We review the possibility that the Supersymmetric Standard Model arises from\\norbifold constructions of the E_8 x E_8 Heterotic Superstring, and the\\nphenomenological properties that such a model should have. In particular,\\ntrying to solve the discrepancy between the unification scale predicted by the\\nHeterotic Superstring (g_{GUT}x5.27x10^{17} GeV) and the value deduced from LEP\\nexperiments (2x10^{16} GeV), we will predict the presence at low energies of\\nthree families of Higgses and vector-like colour triplets. Our approach relies\\non the Fayet-Iliopoulos breaking, and this is also a crucial ingredient,\\ntogether with having three Higgs families, to obtain in these models an\\ninteresting pattern of fermion masses and mixing angles at the renormalizable\\nlebel. Namely, after the gauge breaking some physical particles appear combined\\nwith other states, and the Yukawa couplings are modified in a well controlled\\nway. On the other hand, dangerous flavour-changing neutral currents may appear\\nwhen fermions of a given charge receive their mass through couplings with\\nseveral Higgs doublets.

The 1.3mm\\ncontinuum emission has been resolved into three compact cores, all of which are\\ndominated by dust emission and have radii < 7000AU. The mass estimates for\\nthese cores range from 6 to 35 Msun. The centroid of the brightest dust core\\n(SMA1) is offset by 1.1'' (2800 AU) from the peak of the cometary UCHII region\\nand exhibits the strongest HC3N, CN, and DCN line emission in the region. SMA1\\nalso exhibits compact CH3OH, SiO, and H2CO emission and likely contains a young\\nhot core. We find spatial and kinematic evidence that SMA1 may contain further\\nmultiplicity, with one of the components coincident with a newly-detected H2O\\nmaser. There are no mid-infrared point source counterparts to any of the dust\\ncores, further suggesting an early evolutionary phase for these objects. The\\ndominant mid-infrared emission is a diffuse, broadband component that traces\\nthe surface of the cometary UCHII region but is obscured by foreground material\\non its southern edge. An additional 4.5 micron linear feature emanating to the\\nnortheast of SMA1 is aligned with a cluster of methanol masers and likely\\ntraces a outflow from a protostar within SMA1.

We conclude\\nthat both components are young, comoving members of the association; we also\\npresent high-resolution observations which show that the primary is itself a\\nclose binary system. If the Aab and B components are gravitationally bound, the\\nsystem would fall into the small class of young multiple systems which have\\nunusually wide separations as compared to field systems of similar mass.\\nHowever, we demonstrate that physical association can not be assumed purely on\\nprobabilistic grounds for any individual candidate system in this separation\\nrange. Analysis of the association's two-point correlation function shows that\\nthere is a significant probability (25%) that at least one pair of low-mass\\nassociation members will be separated in projection by <15\\\", so analysis of the\\nwide binary population in Upper Sco will require a systematic search for all\\nwide systems; the detection of another such pair would represent an excess at\\nthe 98% confidence level.\\n\",\n          \"  We calculate the form factors for the semileptonic decays of heavy-light\\npseudoscalar mesons in partially quenched staggered chiral perturbation theory\\n(\\\\schpt), working to leading order in $1/m_Q$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark\\nmass. We take the light meson in the final state to be a pseudoscalar\\ncorresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatment\\nassumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing the\\nstaggered ``fourth root trick'' within \\\\schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4\\nfor each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partially\\nquenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate sea\\nquarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered\\n(and non-degenerate) case. As a by-product, we obtain the continuum partially\\nquenched results with non-degenerate sea quarks. We analyze the effects of\\nnon-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governing\\nthe analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful in\\nanalyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\\\\to\\\\pi$ and $D\\\\to K$ when the\\nlight quarks are simulated with the staggered action.\\n\",\n          \"  The minimum semi-degree of a digraph D is the minimum of its minimum\\noutdegree and its minimum indegree. We show that every sufficiently large\\ndigraph D with minimum semi-degree at least n/2 +k-1 is k-linked. The bound on\\nthe minimum semi-degree is best possible and confirms a conjecture of\\nManoussakis from 1990. We also determine the smallest minimum semi-degree which\\nensures that a sufficiently large digraph D is k-ordered, i.e. that for every\\nordered sequence of k distinct vertices of D there is a directed cycle which\\nencounters these vertices in this order.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"update_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2007-05-23 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2024-02-13 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 256,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2014-11-21 00:00:00\",\n          \"2009-02-05 00:00:00\",\n          \"2010-08-27 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"number_of_authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 44,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 26,\n        \"samples\": [\n          20,\n          26,\n          4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Measurement of Decay Amplitudes of B -->(c cbar) Kstar with an Angular\\n  Analysis, for (c cbar)=J/psi, psi(2S) and chi_c1   We perform the first three-dimensional measurement of the amplitudes of $B\\\\to\\n\\\\psi(2S) K^*$ and $B\\\\to \\\\chi_{c1} K^*$ decays and update our previous\\nmeasurement for $B\\\\to J/\\\\psi K^*$.

This\\n\\\"driven activation\\\" can be quantified by introducing in the Arrhenius\\nexpression an effective temperature, which is close to the one determined from\\nthe fluctuation-dissipation relation. This conclusion is supported by\\nanalytical results for a simplified model system.\\n\",\n          \"Al'tshuler-Aronov correction to the conductivity of a large metallic\\n  square network   We consider the correction $\\\\Delta\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{ee}$ due to\\nelectron-electron interaction to the conductivity of a weakly disordered metal\\n(Al'tshuler-Aronov correction). The correction is related to the spectral\\ndeterminant of the Laplace operator. The case of a large square metallic\\nnetwork is considered. The variation of $\\\\Delta\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{ee}(L_T)$ as a\\nfunction of the thermal length $L_T$ is found very similar to the variation of\\nthe weak localization $\\\\Delta\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{WL}(L_\\\\phi)$ as a function of the\\nphase coherence length. Our result for $\\\\Delta\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{ee}$ interpolates\\nbetween the known 1d and 2d results, but the interaction parameter entering the\\nexpression of $\\\\Delta\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{ee}$ keeps a 1d behaviour.

We conclude\\nthat both components are young, comoving members of the association; we also\\npresent high-resolution observations which show that the primary is itself a\\nclose binary system. If the Aab and B components are gravitationally bound, the\\nsystem would fall into the small class of young multiple systems which have\\nunusually wide separations as compared to field systems of similar mass.\\nHowever, we demonstrate that physical association can not be assumed purely on\\nprobabilistic grounds for any individual candidate system in this separation\\nrange. Analysis of the association's two-point correlation function shows that\\nthere is a significant probability (25%) that at least one pair of low-mass\\nassociation members will be separated in projection by <15\\\", so analysis of the\\nwide binary population in Upper Sco will require a systematic search for all\\nwide systems; the detection of another such pair would represent an excess at\\nthe 98% confidence level.\\n\",\n          \"  We calculate the form factors for the semileptonic decays of heavy-light\\npseudoscalar mesons in partially quenched staggered chiral perturbation theory\\n(\\\\schpt), working to leading order in $1/m_Q$, where $m_Q$ is the heavy quark\\nmass. We take the light meson in the final state to be a pseudoscalar\\ncorresponding to the exact chiral symmetry of staggered quarks. The treatment\\nassumes the validity of the standard prescription for representing the\\nstaggered ``fourth root trick'' within \\\\schpt by insertions of factors of 1/4\\nfor each sea quark loop. Our calculation is based on an existing partially\\nquenched continuum chiral perturbation theory calculation with degenerate sea\\nquarks by Becirevic, Prelovsek and Zupan, which we generalize to the staggered\\n(and non-degenerate) case. As a by-product, we obtain the continuum partially\\nquenched results with non-degenerate sea quarks. We analyze the effects of\\nnon-leading chiral terms, and find a relation among the coefficients governing\\nthe analytic valence mass dependence at this order. Our results are useful in\\nanalyzing lattice computations of form factors $B\\\\to\\\\pi$ and $D\\\\to K$ when the\\nlight quarks are simulated with the staggered action.\\n\",\n          \"  The minimum semi-degree of a digraph D is the minimum of its minimum\\noutdegree and its minimum indegree. We show that every sufficiently large\\ndigraph D with minimum semi-degree at least n/2 +k-1 is k-linked. The bound on\\nthe minimum semi-degree is best possible and confirms a conjecture of\\nManoussakis from 1990. We also determine the smallest minimum semi-degree which\\nensures that a sufficiently large digraph D is k-ordered, i.e. that for every\\nordered sequence of k distinct vertices of D there is a directed cycle which\\nencounters these vertices in this order.\\n\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"update_date\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"date\",\n        \"min\": \"2007-05-23 00:00:00\",\n        \"max\": \"2024-02-13 00:00:00\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 256,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"2014-11-21 00:00:00\",\n          \"2009-02-05 00:00:00\",\n          \"2010-08-27 00:00:00\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"number_of_authors\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"number\",\n        \"std\": 3,\n        \"min\": 1,\n        \"max\": 44,\n        \"num_unique_values\": 26,\n        \"samples\": [\n          20,\n          26,\n          4\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"content\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1000,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Measurement of Decay Amplitudes of B -->(c cbar) Kstar with an Angular\\n  Analysis, for (c cbar)=J/psi, psi(2S) and chi_c1   We perform the first three-dimensional measurement of the amplitudes of $B\\\\to\\n\\\\psi(2S) K^*$ and $B\\\\to \\\\chi_{c1} K^*$ decays and update our previous\\nmeasurement for $B\\\\to J/\\\\psi K^*$.

This\\n\\\"driven activation\\\" can be quantified by introducing in the Arrhenius\\nexpression an effective temperature, which is close to the one determined from\\nthe fluctuation-dissipation relation. This conclusion is supported by\\nanalytical results for a simplified model system.\\n\",\n          \"Al'tshuler-Aronov correction to the conductivity of a large metallic\\n  square network   We consider the correction $\\\\Delta\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{ee}$ due to\\nelectron-electron interaction to the conductivity of a weakly disordered metal\\n(Al'tshuler-Aronov correction). The correction is related to the spectral\\ndeterminant of the Laplace operator. The case of a large square metallic\\nnetwork is considered. The variation of $\\\\Delta\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{ee}(L_T)$ as a\\nfunction of the thermal length $L_T$ is found very similar to the variation of\\nthe weak localization $\\\\Delta\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{WL}(L_\\\\phi)$ as a function of the\\nphase coherence length. Our result for $\\\\Delta\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{ee}$ interpolates\\nbetween the known 1d and 2d results, but the interaction parameter entering the\\nexpression of $\\\\Delta\\\\sigma_\\\\mathrm{ee}$ keeps a 1d behaviour.
